			<div class = "description"><h2>Platform</h2><p>Platform games (or platformers) have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Generally the player's character in a platform game is able to jump many times their own height and player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps. Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with lots of uneven terrain that the player can leap to or fall off of.</p>

			<div class = "description"><h2>Shooter</h2><p>In shooter games (or simply shooters), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance. Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as Splatoon, have non-violent objectives.</p>

			<div class = "description"><h2>Fighting</h2><p>Fighting games center around close-ranged combat typically one on one fights or against a small number of equally powerful opponents, often involving violent and exaggerated unarmed attacks. Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat, some fighting games such as Soulcalibur and Samurai Shodown center around combat with melee weapons.</p>

		<div id="stealth" class = "genre">
			<img src = "../static/images/stealth.jpeg">
			<div class = "description"><h2>Stealth</h2><p>These games tend to emphasize subterfuge and precision strikes over the more overt mayhem of shooters, for example, the Metal Gear series, and the Sly Cooper series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as Dishonored, the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game.</p>

		<div id="survival" class = "genre">
			<img src = "../static/images/survival.jpeg">
			<div class = "description"><h2>Survival</h2><p>Survival games start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the survival horror genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.</p>

The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero.
