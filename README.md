This web app was created for an Elements of Software Engineering course and originally hosted on [GitLab] (https://gitlab.com/noah_pl/cs329e-idb?nav_source=navbar)

The project is configured to be hosted on GCP, but our student GCP accounts are no longer valid.

Do NOT forget to include:
- "venv" inside ".gitignore" to prevent pushing virtual environment to remote repo
- "requirements.txt"
